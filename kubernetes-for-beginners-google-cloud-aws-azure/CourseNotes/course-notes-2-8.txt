In the cloud, it is best practice to delete the resources when you are not using them.



If you do not want to delete and create a new cluster every time, you can reduce the cluster size to zero.



After finishing your classes of the day you can reduce cluster node size to zero.

gcloud container clusters resize --zone <name_of_zone> <name_of_your_cluster> --num-nodes=0



When you are ready to start again, increase the number of nodes:

gcloud container clusters resize --zone <name_of_zone> <name_of_your_cluster> --num-nodes=3
